# Diabetes Prediction
## INTRODUCTION
Proposed Diabetes Prediction is a machine learning application which predicts whether the patient 
whose details have been entered is diabetic or not. There are various parameters on which this model 
will predict the condition. Some of them include the number of pregnancies the patient had, the BMI 
(Body Mass Index), the glucose intake, diastolic blood pressure, skin thickness, age etc.

## OBJECTIVE
The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a 
patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. This 
project aims to predict diabetes via three different supervised machine learning methods including: 
SVM, Logistic regression.
This project also aims to propose an effective technique for earlier detection of the diabetes disease.
## MOTIVATION
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged 
period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased 
hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include 
diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications 
include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.
So it is really important to predict diabetes before any of the disorders take place and this application 
can be easily implemented through various machine learning classification algorithms that have been 
discovered and this can be an further asset to medical sciences.
## EXISTING SYSTEM
In this system, the researchers propose the use of algorithms like Bayesian to apply on diabetes 
patient’s database and analyse them by taking various attributes of diabetes for prediction of 
diabetes disease. A researcher has proposed study on prediction of diabetes using machine 
learning algorithms in healthcare they applied six different machine learning algorithms Performance and accuracy of the applied algorithms is discussed and compared. Comparison of 
the different machine learning techniques used in this study reveals which algorithm is best suited 
for prediction of diabetes. Diabetes Prediction is becoming the area of interest for researchers in 
order to train the program to identify the patient are diabetic or not by applying proper classifier 
on the dataset. Based on previous research work, it has been observed that the classification 
process is not much improved. Hence a system is required as Diabetes Prediction is important 
area in computers, to handle the issues identified based on previous research.
## DATASET
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on 
certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the 
selection of these instances from a larger database. The datasets consists of several medical predictor 
variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the 
patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.<br>
 Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant <br>
 Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test<br>
 Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<br>
 Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)<br>
 Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)<br> BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function<br>
 Age: Age (years)<br>
 Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
## Software Requirement
 Technology used : Machine Learning<br>
 Software used : Anaconda and Jupyter notebook<br>
 Language Used : Python<br>
 Cloud Platform: Heroku<br>
 User Interface Design : HTML , CSS<br>
## HARWARE REQUIREMENT
Processor: Intel i5 processor <br>
RAM: 8GB <br>
Operating System: Any O.S other than Window 7<br>
Hard disk: 256 GB<br>
## EXPECTED OUTCOME
After the building of this machine learning model, we will be able to detect whether the person is 
suffering from diabetes or not as it is necessary for a person to maintain proper health.
## FUTURE SCOPESince this dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases, this may be taken as a real time application to predict diabetes in a patient suffering from 
any of the symptoms and can be a contribution to the medical sciences.
A particular method to identify diabetes is not very sophisticated way for initial diabetes detection and 
it is not fully accurate for predicting diseases. That’s why we need a smart hybrid predictive analytics 
diabetes diagnostic system that can effectively work with accuracy and efficiency. We can use data 
mining, neural network for exploring and utilizing to support medical decision, which improves in 
diagnosing the risk for pregnant diabetes. Due to the dataset we have till date are not up to the mark, 
we cannot predict the type of diabetes, so in future we aim to predicting type of diabetes and explore 
it, which may improve the accuracy of predicting diabetes
